# MultiUnaryQC
Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of the Multi-Unary input encoding schem for the quantum circuit model.

The notebooks accompany the article submitted to Springer Quantum Information Processing journal, entitled "_Multi-Unary: a Dense Input Encoding Scheme for the Quantum Circuit Model_". Specifically:

- The notebook *counterDemo.ipynb* contains Qiskit code implementing the quantum circuit described in section 2.3. It illustrates the use of counters in the design of quantum oracles.
- The notebook *oracleMultiUnary.ipynb* includes Qiskit code for executing the quantum circuit that demostrates the use of Multi-Unary input encoding scheme, as detailed in section 2.4. Additionally, the notebook enumerates all 126 solutions to the sample graph coloring problem discussed in Section 3.
